1，Voltage is expression of potential energy（electric pressure or electric tension）.
   In layman’s terms, it is the measure of “push” available to motivate electrons.

2, Resistance is the measure of the degree to which a conductor opposes an electric current through that conductor

3, Short circuit refers closed circuit.

4, An open circuit is one where the continuity has been broken by an interruption in the path for electrons to flow;
A closed circuit is one that is complete, with good continuity throughout.

5,yes.
